FlikrTest
=========

The project is a test project just to use flickr API. It allows user to browse through the flickr results from search for "squirrel" and show following information

    * The image itself

    * The title of the image

    * the author's username

When an image is selected the app should load a list of the author's images with a navigation button to return to the previous list.
