FlikrTest
=========

Using the flickr API write a small app in any language or for any platform you wish that lets the user browse through the flickr results from search for "squirrel". You can choose to lay out the app as you wish but the following information should be displayed for each result:

    * The image itself

    * The title of the image

    * the author's username

When an image is selected the app should load a list of the author's images with a navigation button to return to the previous list.
